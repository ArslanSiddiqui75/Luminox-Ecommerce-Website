# Luminox | Ecommerce Website
Luminox is a concept e-commerce website for camera gear built as a university project. I handled UI/UX design and frontend development, designing in Figma and building with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a genre-based gear suggestion concept implemented with hard-coded logic for now.
